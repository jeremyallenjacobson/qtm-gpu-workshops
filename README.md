# QTM GPU workshops

## October workshop: Background on GPU computing 
This is part one in a three-part series of workshops with the agenda of guiding QTM faculty towards new use cases for the QTM GPU cluster in faculty teaching and research. This workshop provides general background on GPU computing covering foundational terminology and concepts. 
The recording is available [here](https://emory-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/jajaco3_emory_edu/ERBfG7ZQWmxItawDDzfo6a4BD5ldCD6YMq8M6x-lnIV-mQ?e=2Z0XYc) and the [slides](./workshop1slides-GPU-computing-background.pdf) are located in this repo.

## November workshop: Frameworks for GPU computing
This is part two in the three part series of workshops. This workshop provides an introduction to various machine learning and data science frameworks for GPU computing including PyTorch. The recording is available [here](https://emory-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/jajaco3_emory_edu/EW8JeItwymVKgbS1X9MrbW4BDvud6rUEfe8SWi27N5v_gA?e=CnvMb5) and the [slides](./workshop2slides-GPU-computing-frameworks.pdf) and [notebook](./matrix-multiply-compared.ipynb) are located in this repo.



## December workshop: Slurm and the QTM cluster
This is part three in the three part series of workshops. This workshop provides an introduction to the job scheduler, Slurm, that QTM uses for managing the GPU cluster. Attendees will learn how to submit jobs and run machine learning training scripts on the GPU cluster.
